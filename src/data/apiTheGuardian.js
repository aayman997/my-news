					body: '<p>It’s been 111 days since Hollywood writers put down their pens and 38 days since actors joined them, both guilds striking in the hopes of building a fairer industry for today and the many days ahead. While there have been recent signs of potential progress (especially for writers with the WGA set for <a href="https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/wga-meets-again-amptp-no-deal-1235700059/">another vital meeting</a> this week), the situation remains without any clear endpoint and as the days pile up, so does the wreckage.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/21/ai-jobs-hollywood-writers-actors-strike">‘Embrace it or risk obsolescence’: how will AI jobs affect Hollywood?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Major movie productions, from Gladiator 2 to Deadpool 3, have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/19/what-movies-affected-actors-strike-2023-gladiator-2-mission-impossible">forced into a pause</a>, with mounting costs for studios and a loss of income for those working on them. Much-anticipated new films, from the Zendaya-led drama <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/21/challengers-zendaya-venice-film-festival-strike">Challengers</a> to the Marvel adventure Kraven the Hunter, were pushed off their 2023 release dates into the new year. New seasons of TV shows, such as Amazon’s queer spin on A League of Their Own, were <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/a-league-of-their-own-canceled-as-amazon-flips-on-abbreviated-final-season-1235570207/">cancelled</a>, while plans for others, such as Apple’s $188m take on Metropolis, were binned entirely.</p> <p>While the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/24/barbie-oppenheimer-movie-release-box-office-ticket-sales">Barbenheimer</a> juggernaut continues (the two films are set to cross $2bn in joint ticket sales this week), other films have struggled at the box office. The strike has meant that actors have been unable to engage with the regular interview circuit, meaning that a major component of a film’s awareness campaign has been decimated. Last week, the Hollywood Reporter <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/box-office-ninja-turtles-star-campaigns-1235568835/">estimated</a> that the box office for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has been hit by up to 15% with stars such as Seth Rogen, Jackie Chan, Maya Rudolph and Ice Cube unable to appear at the premiere, speak to journalists or appear on late-night shows (which are all still on hiatus without writers able to work). This weekend also saw Universal’s foul-mouthed dog comedy Strays sputter out, tracking to make up to $20m for the weekend but <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/08/box-office-blue-beetle-strays-barbie-1235522235/">crashing with just $8m</a>, with stars Will Ferrell and Jamie Foxx muzzled (the latter unable to utilise his 16.8 million Instagram followers). DC’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/16/dc-latino-superhero-film-blue-beetle-review">Blue Beetle</a> also saw the company’s worst ever opening over the weekend and while the film was short on A-listers, it’s likely that a promotional bump would have helped raise its profile.</p> <p>Network schedules for the upcoming season have also seen a substantial overhaul, with hit shows such as Grey’s Anatomy and NCIS delayed indefinitely and instead, game shows such as the David Spade-hosted Snake Oil and reality shows such as Bachelor in Paradise and Kitchen Nightmares taking the primetime slots. Some networks have also chosen to pay for imports instead, like the UK version of Ghosts, or moved cable or streaming dramas over, like Ms Marvel and Yellowstone. With this summer seeing linear TV viewing dropping to <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/linear-tv-viewing-share-low-streaming-record-high-nielsen-1235696629/">a new low</a>, it’s a disastrous prospect for networks, unable to build on recent successes such as Abbott Elementary and Fire Country.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="58987ccdbb3ca781497aee0a8fb93593022d43b5"> <img src="https://media.guim.co.uk/58987ccdbb3ca781497aee0a8fb93593022d43b5/0_44_3000_1800/1000.jpg" alt="Carey Mulligan and Bradley Cooper in Maestro" width="1000" height="600" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Carey Mulligan and Bradley Cooper in Maestro.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Jason McDonald/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The end of the summer is also the start of the all-important fall festival season, where starry films get unveiled around the world aiming for critical adoration leading to awards recognition. It all begins with the Venice film festival on 30 August, the starting point for major contenders in the past such as Gravity, A Star is Born, Dune and Birdman. The quality of this year’s lineup was briefly in question (Luca Guadagnino’s tennis romance Challengers was set to open but was pulled once the actors’ strike began) but does now, to the relief of many, look to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/25/venice-film-festival-picks-starry-films-despite-actors-strike">as robust as ever</a> with new films from David Fincher, Michael Mann, Yorgos Lanthimos, Sofia Coppola and Bradley Cooper. Yet whatever attention the festival usually receives will probably be muted, with stars such as Michael Fassbender, Emma Stone and Carey Mulligan unable to attend, glitzy premiere pictures in short supply. Given that the directors’ guild remains strike-free, column inches might be taken up by the appearance of Roman Polanski and Woody Allen, whose latest films are controversial inclusions.</p> <p>Given that it was made by an independent company rather than a studio, Mann’s motoring drama Ferrari <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/08/ferrari-sag-aftra-waiver-adam-driver-penelope-cruz-1235459750/">has received a waiver</a> from Sag-Aftra that would allow stars Adam Driver and Penélope Cruz to appear at both Venice and the New York film festival, where it’s nabbed the closing night slot, but questions remain over whether the actors will be too, understandably, concerned about optics to attend. Various productions outside of the studio and streamer system have also been granted waivers allowing them to proceed, such as David Lowery’s pop star drama Mother Mary starring Anne Hathaway, but some stars have still chosen not to participate. Viola Davis’s action thriller G20 was given permission to continue production but the actor still <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/viola-davis-waiver-g20-actors-strike-1235450850/">decided against</a>, saying in a statement that she didn’t feel it “would be appropriate” to carry on.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/29/los-angeles-actors-writers-strike-businesses-affected">Dry cleaners, restaurants, hotels: the ripple effects of Hollywood’s strike</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Concurrently with Venice, the Telluride film festival will take place, its lineup still a secret, followed by Toronto, the biggest in size of them all. While this year’s set of films includes Emily Blunt, Kate Winslet, Scarlett Johansson and Olivia Colman, it’s unlikely many big names will appear, despite some films technically allowing for it (this year has more sales titles without studio attachment).</p> <p>While the Warner Bros Discovery CEO, David Zaslav, has <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-discovery-streaming-profit-subscribers-cost-savings-debt-1235548582/">claimed</a> in the short term the strike has actually saved the company $100m in second-quarter operating costs, the WGA has <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/05/wga-strike-costing-studios-30-million-a-day-guild-says-1235367477/">calculated</a> that the strike is costing California’s economy an estimated $30m a day (the last writers’ strike in 2007-2008 reportedly cost over $2bn for the state and CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/09/hollywood-strikes-have-had-3-billion-impact-on-california-economy-so-far.html#:~:text=Work-,Hollywood%20strikes%20have%20already%20had%20a%20%243%20billion%20impact%20on,causing%20\'a%20lot%20of%20hardship\'&amp;text=People%20take%20selfies%20beneath%20the,2023%20in%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California.">reports</a> that if the strikes go on until October, the number could go past $5bn). The demands set forth by the guild, which include improved streaming residuals and a more concrete form of protection against artificial intelligence, are <a href="https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/wga-strike-cost-memo-amptp-1235614992/">estimated</a> to cost the industry a relatively modest $429m a year, considerably less than the culmination of shuttered sets (Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/features/hollywood-chaos-strikes-movie-delays-pay-battles-a-i-anxiety-1235673080/">reports</a> that soundstages, used on major productions like Gladiator 2, cost up to $600,000 a week to retain), reduced box office and the impact to advertising revenue (in July, brand spending on new viewing content <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/hollywood-strikes-could-cause-advertisers-divert-video-spending">fell by 21%</a>, the lowest since the pandemic).</p> <p>Back in July, three days before the actors’ strike was official, <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/writers-strike-hollywood-studios-deal-fight-wga-actors-1235434335/">Deadline</a> quoted an unnamed studio source who said that the plan was for writers to “start losing their apartments and losing their houses”, a statement that led to widespread anger within the industry and one that was used earlier this month by the actor Billy Porter who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/aug/09/billy-porter-house-actors-strike">claims</a> to have lost his house over a lack of income caused by the strike. “The life of an artist, until you make fuck-you money – which I haven’t made yet – is still check-to-check,” he said, adding: “… to the person who said, ‘We’re going to starve them out until they have to sell their apartments’ – you’ve already starved me out.” This week, the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/the-strikes-toll-on-mental-health-1235566619/">Hollywood Reporter</a> also reported on a rise in mental health concerns among those on strike.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="eb140ff7de40e4b2cf19daccaf54aab83b838f02"> <img src="https://media.guim.co.uk/eb140ff7de40e4b2cf19daccaf54aab83b838f02/0_79_6000_3600/1000.jpg" alt="Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya in Dune Part 2" width="1000" height="600" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya in Dune Part 2.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Niko Tavernise</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So what’s next? If the studios still refuse to make necessary compromises, the industry could be facing a particularly cold end to the year. Rumours have already circulated suggesting that star-led films such as Dune 2 and Aquaman 2 (big-budget sequels which rely on the celebrity of stars such as Timothée Chalamet, Jason Momoa and Zendaya) could be next to move off their release dates, following up the success of Barbenheimer with a tentpole-lacking few months. An actor-free awards season will also mean the gutting of an entire industry of its own with no roundtables, events or campaigning of any sort, something that purists might welcome, but financial sway will still win out regardless, with visibility being awarded to whichever studio has the most money to spend on the most adverts. The Television Academy has already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/10/emmy-awards-emmys-2023-postponed-2024">pushed</a> this September’s Emmy awards to next year in hopes that by then, a lifting of the strike will allow for stars to both campaign publicly and to appear at the ceremony (the end of the writers’ strike would also allow for a slick, scripted evening).</p> <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2023/08/18/actor-and-writer-strikes-draw-broad-bipartisan-support-poll-says/?sh=4e1a9ae92bd5">A recent poll</a> showed that about 67% of Americans support the strikes with a growing number also feeling less favourably towards the studios when learning about the details, a worrying result for companies leaning more and more on brand awareness, creating streaming services based on attachment to Paramount or Disney etc. As more films are delayed and shows are canceled then the streamers and networks will also find it harder to sustain subscribers, already stretched with too many services to choose from (in June, research <a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/uh-oh-us-consumers-are-using-fewer-streaming-services-for-the-first-time">suggested</a> that Americans are using fewer services than in the year prior).</p> <p>While, sadly, the below-the-line damage caused is unlikely to have had much of a reaction from the higher-ups, the bigger and closer it gets, the more they’re likely to take it seriously. In May, Bernie Sanders <a href="https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1653455222516088861?lang=en">tweeted</a> that in 2022, eight Hollywood CEOs made nearly $800m as pay for TV writers has fallen by 23% over the last decade. Recent quarterly earnings reports <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/strike-earnings-hollywood-sagaftra-wga-1235567738/">showed</a> that some execs are starting to feel the squeeze in strike-era Hollywood, a surer sign than most that those at the top will be more energised to see this come to an end.</p>',

is good for Australian children</strong></p> <p>Three children scramble over rocks in a low-level Brisbane creek bed when four-year-old Jasper finds a yabby. At least, he thinks it’s a yabby – it could be a crayfish or possibly some other unlucky creature caught in his small, handheld net. More children run to join the debate, their gumboots slipping on the creek’s muddy banks as shrieks of excitement match those of the cockatoos in the leafy canopy above. The children, aged three to six, crowd around their educator to theorise about the discovery – what could it be? Where did it come from? Should they let it go or bring it out of the creek?</p> <p>It’s this kind of hands-on learning that proponents of forest school say can only be found in the great outdoors. Over the course of three hours, the class of 24 explores the suburban creek and bushland, with small hands kept busy collecting sticks and digging in the mud; worlds created in complex games between tree logs and boulders; and little bodies stopping to rest on colourful blankets by the creek to eat, read or join in a nature-based craft activity (today is lantern-making to celebrate the winter solstice).</p> <p>It’s not long before someone asks:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Can we have fire?</p> </blockquote> <p>The answer, perhaps surprisingly, is yes.</p> <p>For more on this story, read the full feature by <strong>Margaret de Silva</strong>:</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/23/bush-learning-boom-forest-school-kindy-beach-outdoor-immersion">Behind the bush learning boom: why getting dirty and lighting fires is good for Australian children</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2023-07-23T02:18:19.690Z">at 3.18am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-64bc5ed48f08ff360bcb302a" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2023-07-23T01:49:32.711Z">2.49am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>South Australian teachers facing workload pressures told to focus on “learning only”</strong></p> <p>South Australian teachers have been urged to stop performing duties not directly related to learning when school resumes for term three amid ongoing negotiations for a new enterprise agreement.</p> <p>The Australian Education Union’s branch president Andrew Gohl says public schools have an escalating staffing crisis.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Educators are papering over the cracks with their unpaid goodwill and the government is taking advantage of it.</p> <p>Parents probably don’t realise their child’s teacher is working 50 hours to keep a broken system running, working late into the night and on weekends to fulfil data and admin requirements.</p> </blockquote> <p>Teachers return to the classrooms on Monday after a two-week break.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="399e2b19f0eec407e2619e26dbe7d93ecc2d21a3"> <img src="https://media.guim.co.uk/399e2b19f0eec407e2619e26dbe7d93ecc2d21a3/0_167_5045_3029/1000.jpg" alt="School students walking." width="1000" height="600" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">The AEU says public schools in South Australia have a staffing crisis which is getting worse.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gohl said the union had been negotiating a new pay and conditions agreement with the state government for more than six months, pursuing a bold platform focused on reducing workload and increasing student support.</p> <p>But he said it was clear the education department did not understand the issues and had not offered any solutions.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We’ve put forward over 20 constructive proposals based on extensive consultation and backed by academic research.

					body: '<p>One of the co-founders of LadBible, a digital platform that creates content aimed at young men, has decided not to return to work after taking a seven-month sabbatical from the business.</p> <p>Arian Kalantari, who set up LadBible with a school friend, Alexander “Solly” Solomou, and developed it into a successful digital platform with millions of followers, resigned this week, saying it was the right time “to create space in my life for new challenges and new adventures”.</p> <p>He had been on sabbatical since January, shortly after getting married.</p> <p>He said: “It has been an incredible journey to see this business grow and thrive over the 11 years since Solly and I founded it.” He said he would remain a “passionate supporter” of LBG Media, LadBible’s parent company.</p> <p>In a statement, Solomou thanked his “good friend” Kalantari for “his support over the years, both in terms of the vital contribution to the founding of the business and the years of success that have been achieved since”.</p> <p>LBG Media announced Kalantari’s departure as chief operating officer while issuing results showing revenues for the first half of 2023 had increased 10% to £27.2m.</p> <p>Solomou said it was a strong performance against a “tough macroeconomic backdrop” and demonstrated engagement with “the hard-to-reach 18- to 34-year-old demographic”.</p> <p>Kalantari retains a 2.7% stake in LBG Media, which is valued at £165m. The company claims its social media content – mainly video and photos, some posted by users, the rest harvested from the internet – reaches 28.5 million people in the UK and 115 million in the US on social media.</p> <p>LBG Media’s website states: “As well as sharing content submitted by our community, we produce articles, celebrity interviews, documentaries, reality shows, political live-streams and hard-hitting social purpose campaigns – all with our youth audience and their interests in mind.</p> <p>“We’re not just about viral entertainment. Our audience turn to us at big moments on serious issues.”</p> <p>In 2012, Laura Bates, of Everyday Sexism, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/sites-like-uni-lad-only-act-to-support-our-everyday-rape-culture-8360109.html">accused</a> the company’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/oct/16/ladbible-snaps-up-social-media-rival-unilad">UniLad site</a> of “encouraging rape culture” and “a culture of misogyny sickeningly disguised as ‘banter’”.</p> <p>In 2015, Solomou <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/dec/12/lad-bible-manners-hero-alexander-solomou">told the Guardian</a> that the company had been on “a learning curve”, saying it no longer endorsed the idea of lads as “louts”.</p> <p>“In my eyes, the lad is someone who spots a grandma crossing the road with heavy shopping, someone with manners, who is polite, who can be a hero,” he said.</p> <p>Kalantari and Solomou, both 32, founded the business a few years after leaving Stockport grammar school.</p> <p>As well as LadBible and UniLad, the Manchester-based LBG Media also counts SportBible and GamingBible among its platforms, plus Tyla, which is aimed at a female audience.</p>',

					body: '<p>A union representing thousands of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/27/wilko-administrators-urged-to-accept-rescue-deal-after-second-bid">workers at Wilko</a> is seeking an urgent meeting with the business secretary after being told by potential rescuers of “difficulties” in engaging with the administrators who will decide upon the stricken retail chain’s future.</p> <p>On Monday, the GMB national secretary, Andy Prendergast, wrote to Kemi Badenoch asking her to ensure that PricewaterhouseCoopers considered all bids for the budget retailer where 12,500 jobs were hanging in the balance.</p> <p>The gardening to beauty retailer, which has 400 stores, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/10/wilko-collapses-into-administration-after-rescue-talks-fail">called in administrators</a> this month after running short of cash. Its shops are expected to close within weeks, with thousands of job losses unless a buyout can be secured.</p> <p>The shuttering of Wilko stores will leave more big gaps on UK high streets that have been severely hit by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/28/britain-loses-6000-retail-outlets-in-five-years-as-shops-close">loss of 6,000 retail outlets in the past five years</a>.</p> <p>Several parties, who say they will retain the jobs if successful, have emerged as contenders to take over the business. Doug Putman, a Canadian entrepreneur who returned the HMV music and film retail chain to profit, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/25/wilko-rescue-deal-canadian-entrepreneur-union-employees">last week submitted a second offer</a> that would mean the stores would continue to operate under the Wilko brand.</p> <p>M2 Capital, a UK-Canadian private equity firm that owns a string of upmarket hotels around the world under the COMO brand, also put forward a bid on Friday. At least one other potential bidder from the UK is considering making an offer, although no formal bid has been entered, the Guardian understands.</p> <p>Any new bid would face a race against time if it is to preserve workers’ jobs. PwC said on Wednesday it was probable that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/23/wilko-close-majority-stores-loss-thousands-jobs-retailer-uk">majority of Wilko’s stores would close</a> and there would be redundancies, adding that it had not found a buyer for the whole group. A decision on the first closures and redundancies is thought to be imminent, and could come as soon as this week, although Wilko stores are continuing to trade.</p> <p>However, in the letter to Badenoch seen by the Guardian, Prendergast said: “We are concerned that prior to our involvement, several of these bidders have reported difficulties engaging the appointed administrators.” Several bidders “appear to have the necessary funding and the willingness to invest and safeguard our members’ job”, he added.</p> <p>The GMB also raised concerns over the role of Hilco Capital, a private equity firm that lent Wilko about £40m this year. A Hilco subsidiary holds the rights to income from the sale of the Wilko brand. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/barclay">Barclays Bank</a> also holds a charge over several plots of land owned by the retailer.</p> <p>As administrator, PwC has an obligation to try to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/25/experts-sceptical-wilko-deal-will-emerge-with-creditors-in-driving-seat">protect the interests of creditors including Hilco</a>. The GMB said it was concerned about the influence of Hilco and that the private equity firm’s interests did not necessarily align with retaining workers’ jobs. Hilco was approached for comment.</p> <p>A PwC spokesperson said: “Since our appointment as administrators of Wilko we have worked relentlessly to secure a sale of the business, and talks are continuing with a number of parties. As administrators, we’re intent on achieving the best outcome for everyone involved while preserving as many jobs as possible and adhering to our statutory duty to act in the best interests of the creditors as a whole.</p> <p>“It would be inappropriate to comment on individual bidders or interested parties at this stage in the process,” they added.</p> <p>The GMB argues that no redundancies should take place at Wilko if meaningful offers have been tabled that will protect jobs. The business secretary would not have powers to intervene directly in the administration, but could put pressure on parties to try to save jobs.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “While this is a commercial decision for the company, we understand that this will be a concerning time for workers at Wilko.</p> <p>“We have backed businesses all of sizes with an unprecedented package of support including recent fuel duty and VAT cuts, business rates holidays and government backed loans worth around £400bn. We will continue to stand firmly behind them.”</p> <p>The union said it was seeking assurances from the government that all bids would be considered, and that where possible all steps would be taken to “protect jobs as part of this process”. Prendergast argued that the bids could save the government millions of pounds in redundancy costs and notice pay that would be required if Wilko enters liquidation.</p>',

					body: '<p>The Guardian’s parent company made record revenues for its news business last year as the group hired new staff and pushed for further international growth.</p> <p>Total revenues at Guardian Media Group (GMG) increased to £264.4m but the company recorded a cash outflow of £21m in the 2022-23 financial year, in line with planned spending.</p> <p>This followed the decision to hire additional journalists and invest in newsletters and podcasts.</p> <p>The British arm of the business was hit by continuing declines in print newspaper sales and a weak UK advertising market.</p> <p>This was partly offset by substantial increases in financial contributions from readers in North America and Australia, with more than a third of the company’s income now coming from outside the UK.</p> <p>GMG said it was targeting further growth in Europe, with the company hiring additional journalists to serve readers on the continent.</p> <p>The chief executive, Anna Bateson, said: “The Guardian is becoming a truly global news organisation. In a difficult economic climate we have continued to invest in quality journalism and in our digital business capabilities to advance this strategy which has brought revenue growth and a continued rise in digital reader revenues from across the globe.</p> <p>“Despite challenges across the global media industry we will continue to invest and build a platform for long term success.”</p> <p>Spending on wages rose from £131m to £152.6m as the company hired more staff around the world.</p> <p>The company also had to deal with the costs of a cyber-attack at the end of 2022, which is not specified in the company’s accounts.</p> <p>The company has more than 1 million paying supporters, and claims 1.4bn average monthly page views on its website and 148m average monthly unique browsers.</p> <p>Income from digital products accounts for 70% of revenue, substantially more than most other British newspaper publishers, which remain heavily reliant on print newspaper sales.</p> <p>Unlike other British newspaper groups, the Guardian is not owned by a wealthy individual or a listed company that has to return profits to shareholders. Instead, its proprietor is the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust">Scott Trust</a>, which maintains an investment fund – worth about £1.2bn – that is used to subsidise the newspaper and secure the Guardian’s editorial independence. The trust uses this money to provide GMG with access to a cash injection of up to £30m a year, enabling the business to make some limited financial losses.</p> <p>Many UK newspaper publishers are being hit by both a weak advertising market and the rapidly increasing cost of newsprint. Outlets that receive ongoing financial contributions direct from readers continue to outperform publishers that are reliant on digital advertising, as shown by two other newspaper groups that released their financial results on Tuesday.</p> <p>Telegraph Media Group’s annual accounts showed a rise in subscriptions, boosted by the decision to buy a magazine publisher and an aggressive online sales pitch. In contrast, Reach – the parent company of the Mirror, Express and many local newspapers – is heavily reliant on income from online advertising. Its results showed a substantially gloomier outlook, with digital revenue falling by 19% year-on-year as advertisers cut back spending amid economic uncertainty.</p>',

Privatisation was pitched in the 1980s as a solution to systemic weakness in public services and the wider British state, but instead we’re left with a business model so broken that it benefits neither economy nor society.</p> <p>As costs rocket and quality plummets, polling routinely shows public support for nationalisation – but not every firm follows the same blueprint. Unlike Thames Water, Welsh Water runs a non-profit model solely benefiting the public, returning more than £440m in customer dividends and enjoying a much higher credit rating. Nationalisation dominates the debate, but we have other viable alternatives.</p> <p>The stark contrast between Thames and Welsh Water is rooted in the choice of social enterprise over traditional business models. Problems of privatisation are fundamentally linked to ownership, with shareholders putting profits before people and assets being hoarded rather than shared. Other business models expand ownership to workers, customers and wider communities, reinvesting profits to improve services and reduce costs.</p> <p>Only a crisis, actual or perceived, brings about real change – and Thames Water presents an opportunity to do better business, by putting the public back into public services.<br><strong>Victor Adebowale</strong><br><em>Chair, Social Enterprise UK</em></p>',

Yates said the federal contribution was “an assumption that we took at face value”.</p> <p>Leigh Walker, another partner at EY, said she could not answer the question because it could reveal confidential cabinet information. Walker also declined to disclose how much EY was paid to contribute to the business case.</p> <p>The federal government had not committed to any contribution to the Commonwealth Games before the Andrews government announced its cancellation.</p> <p>Yates said the consulting firm’s ability to provide a thorough cost estimate of the Games had been constrained by the Victorian government wanting to keep early discussions about the games confidential.</p> <p>“Given the confidential nature of this project, the discussions were confined to a core project team of key stakeholders and did not involve sporting organisations, venue operators and other government departments or the commonwealth government,” he said.</p> <p>“It meant that we were estimating preliminary costs because the ability to verify those things was limited given the constraints that we had.”</p> <p>The former Victorian sports minister, Martin Pakula, also faced the inquiry on Monday and defended a conversation he held with the Morrison government in 2022 over federal funding for the Commonwealth Games.</p> <p>The Age reported last week that Pakula, who was Victoria’s sports minister when the event was announced, had indicated to the federal government last year that Victoria did not need additional funding to secure the event.</p> <p>Pakula said he made his comments because at the time the Victorian government was committed to proceeding with the event regardless of whether or not it had commonwealth support.</p> <p>“There is a significant difference between asking or not asking for money now versus not asking for money ever,” he said.</p> <p>“We were not going to be in a position to wait for an answer from the commonwealth given the timelines of the bid process and the announcement.”</p> <p>Commonwealth Games Australia organisers told the inquiry that the sporting body was focused on trying to find another host for the event and were hopeful it could still be held in Australia.</p> <p>Basil Zempalis, the lord mayor of Perth, on Monday told the inquiry it was unlikely the West Australian capital could host it because the state government did not believe it would deliver a return on investment.</p> <p>Tom Tate, the Gold Coast lord mayor, said there was a chance the city could still host the 2026 event.</p> <p>But Anthony Albanese has previously dashed Tate’s hopes of commonwealth funding, saying the federal government was focused on the 2032 Olympics and Paralympics in Brisbane.</p> <p>Zempilas and Tate previously called for Perth and the Gold Coast to co-host the 2026 Commonwealth Games after Victoria cancelled the event.</p>',

However they have been off the pace since the regulation changes of 2022, with Red Bull <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/31/max-verstappen-red-bull-dominance-formula-one" title="">and Max Verstappen dominant</a>, the Dutchman winning the title last year and on his way to closing out this season already. Hamilton was unequivocal that he believed Mercedes could return to winning ways in the forthcoming two years.</p> \n<p>“We’re trying to win more world championships, so the unfinished business is getting us back to the top,” he said. “It’s getting back and fighting for world championships. We’ve been the most successful team in history but it’s been a challenge this past year, so I think actually [it’s about] getting us back to where we belong and operate on all those cylinders, which you’re seeing Red Bull do.”</p> \n<figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="a48c6b133d7025f3ab5dcbe861e357c80510206d"> \n <img src="https://media.guim.co.uk/a48c6b133d7025f3ab5dcbe861e357c80510206d/0_213_3500_2100/1000.jpg" alt="Lewis Hamilton celebrates with his dog Roscoe and his team after winning the Turkish Grand Prix to secure his seventh world championship on 15 November 2020" width="1000" height="600" class="gu-image"> \n <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Hamilton celebrates with his dog Roscoe and his team after winning the Turkish Grand Prix to secure his seventh world championship in 2020.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: PA Wire/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Since he was controversially denied his eighth title <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/12/f1-max-verstappen-wins-abu-dhabi-gp-lewis-hamilton" title="">in the season finale at Abu Dhabi</a> in 2021, won by Verstappen, the British driver has been determined to continue his attempts to claim another. Mercedes have been clear they believe the decision-making in Abu Dhabi was wrong and the FIA’s own investigation concluded <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/fia-report-blames-human-error-for-abu-dhabi-gp-controversy-but-result-stands" title="">there had been human error.</a> Hamilton however was adamant that the unfinished business he referred to did not include a desire to put right what he was denied that day.</p> \n<p>“I’m not really a revenge person and it’s not about revenge,” he said. “It’s not about redemption</p> \n<p>“That’s in the past and there is nothing you can do about the past. What we can do is work harder, be more precise and be better moving forwards.”</p> \n<p>Hamilton made his debut with McLaren in 2007 and won his first title with the team a year later. The records he has achieved since then are remarkable. He is F1’s most successful driver, equal with Michael Schumacher on seven titles, and has the most wins and the most pole positions with 103 and 104 respectively.</p> \n<p>His future had been under question as the new deal had taken so long to be sealed but Hamilton had insisted all year it was all but done, with only fine-tuning required. It was finally concluded over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/27/max-verstappen-wins-dutch-f1-gp-to-delight-of-orange-army" title="">last weekend’s Dutch GP.</a></p> \n<p>The challenge ahead remains difficult, especially with Red Bull enjoying such a dominant car, but Hamilton was clear he felt his passion for the sport was undiminished despite the longevity of his career.</p> \n<p>“I definitely didn’t think that I’d be the age that I am and feel the way that I do physically and mentally and still love what I’m doing as much as I do,” he said. “A lot of people stay in the same jobs and roles for a long period of time, and fall out of love with it. I genuinely still have that love for what I’m doing. I still love getting in the car, I still love racing with my peers.”</p>',

					body: '<p>As a longtime owner of a technology consulting firm I have something to disclose publicly: I discriminate. I have turned down new clients and fired existing clients. I’ve never refused to do business because of the color of someone’s skin, sexual orientation or their religion. But I have refused to do business with people that behaved rudely, unprofessionally or were jerks to either myself or my employees. It had nothing to do with the services requested or their ability to pay. It was just my decision. I chose not to do business with these people.</p> <p>Putting individual jerks aside, when it comes to last week’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jun/30/us-supreme-court-ruling-lgbtq-rights-colorado">supreme court ruling</a> that allows businesses to discriminate against a whole class of people, I’d urge small businesses to think twice.</p> <p>In this case, a web designer in Colorado didn’t want to perform services for an LGBTQ+ customer because of religious convictions. This is not the first time this has happened. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/24/bakersfield-california-bakery-same-sex-wedding-cake">California</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/jun/04/gay-cake-ruling-supreme-court-same-sex-wedding-colorado-baker-decision-latest">Colorado</a> bakers opted not to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding. There are numerous other examples where businesses turned away customers and all for a myriad of reasons. One <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/24/joes-music-trump-supporters-stop-selling-products">music store in Ohio</a> refused to serve a supporter of Donald Trump. As long as they’re within the law, that’s their prerogative.</p> <p>But if you’re a small business owner, be aware. You can decide not to work with a whole class of people if your beliefs don’t jive with them. But you do so at your own peril.</p> <p>We need every customer we can get. Every dollar counts, at least for me. And it doesn’t just count for me. Small business owners aren’t just responsible for themselves. They are responsible for others. Their employees, customers, partners, suppliers and even their community. My family relies on my business for the income it provides. All of these people also rely on my business for the income it provides to them and their families. Turning away work just because you don’t agree with someone’s sexual orientation hurts not just those people (which is bad enough) but everyone that relies on that business for their livelihoods.</p> <p>Big brands, retail stores and restaurant chains don’t question the religious beliefs or sexual orientation of every customer who walks in the door or buys a product because they have shareholders and investors. Even Chick-fil-A, whose public <a href="https://www.chick-fil-a.com/careers/culture">mission statement</a> is “To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us” will still sell a Spicy Chicken Sandwich to an atheist.</p> <p>Because of their religious beliefs, the Colorado web designer has now pissed off the LGBTQ+ community, all their friends, allies and families. People talk. Small businesses live off of referrals and businesses of all sizes go out of their way to be seen favorably by the public. They advertise. They seek media attention. They sponsor events. They avoid controversy. The web designer in Colorado, is now famous. But not in a good way. Sure, there are some that are going to take their side. But when a business publicly does something in the name of politics or religion, they’re pretty much guaranteed of upsetting a significant number of both current and prospective customers.</p> <p>So go ahead and discriminate. Scotus says it’s fine. But do so at your own peril.</p>',

Today it is the turn of the cuckoo flower to appear, yesterday it was hawthorn blossom.</p> <p>The main business of the month, though, is lambing. I walk around our in-bye fields three times a day, clocking up thousands of steps and about 12 miles a day, according to my phone’s health app. I keep getting alerts that I’m “trending higher for 15 days”, though my whole body knows this already.</p> <p>Lambing is a physical business. This morning there are two sprightly lambs to catch and reunite with their mother – they have somehow got on to the wrong side of a fence. They bleat for my attention, then dash off when I try to catch them.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/30/country-diary-a-pregnant-pause-as-the-ewes-return-for-lambing">Country diary: a pregnant pause as the ewes return for lambing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I put the head of my shepherd’s crook close to the floor and they run into it. Then I lean over the fence and lift them up and back to their mother. Just one of the hundreds of issues that I will encounter during the day.</p> <p>As I walk, I collect up the remains of last week’s storm. There was a night of wind and rain, and I went round the day before and put plastic lamb macs on all the newborn lambs.</p> <p>For a farm trying to reduce its use of plastic this was not ideal, but the macs showed their worth: no casualties overnight. They degrade over time, but as the lambs burst out of them after a couple of days (as they grow so fast), I still prefer to stash them in my pocket and recycle them rather than leave them blowing around the fields.</p> <p>In the far meadow there is a young yow struggling to lamb. I catch her foot in the shepherd’s crook and gently tip her over. One leg of the lamb is back, but half a minute later, with a quick pull and a rush of fluids, the lamb slides out on to my leg.</p> <p>He shakes his head and splutters. The yow begins to clean him, chuntering softly and contentedly.</p> <p>• Country diary is on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/gdncountrydiary?lang=en" title="">@gdncountrydiary</a></p>',

					body: '<p>If we are what we eat, then we are increasingly composed from substances including synthetic emulsifiers, flavour compounds, bulking agents and stabilising gums (one of the most common being a slime produced by bacteria). Well over half of the average diet in the UK and US now consists of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/13/how-ultra-processed-food-took-over-your-shopping-basket-brazil-carlos-monteiro" title="">ultra‑processed food</a> (UPF) – or, as one scientist prefers to put it, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2023/apr/20/how-did-ultra-processed-foods-take-over-and-what-are-they-doing-to-us" title="">industrially produced edible substances</a>.<strong> </strong>Though defining it technically is <a href="https://www.fao.org/3/ca5644en/ca5644en.pdf" title="">complex</a>, the simple explanation is that it contains items you wouldn’t normally find in a kitchen.</p> <p>Sometimes UPF looks like junk food – obviously artificial and high in salt, fat and sugar. But it often comes in reassuring forms such as soup, muesli or yoghurt. “Almost every food that comes with a health claim on the packet is a UPF,” notes Dr Chris van Tulleken drily in <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/451300/ultra-processed-people-by-tulleken-chris-van/9781529900057" title="">Ultra-Processed People</a>, one of <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/unprocessed-by-kimberley-wilson-review-phqzvf7mq" title="">several recent books</a> on the subject.</p> <p>This is despite the fact that, as he also notes, “a vast body of data has emerged in support of the hypothesis that UPF damages the human body and increases rates of cancer, metabolic disease and mental illness”. The problem is not only obesity: the greater risk of heart disease, strokes and early death with higher consumption apply irrespective of weight gain.</p> <p>Produced by a handful of multinational companies, UPF is created to be cheap to produce and transport, with industrially derived substances replacing costlier ingredients and ensuring long shelf lives. It is also designed to make us buy more – essential in a system where businesses must keep growing to satisfy their shareholders each quarter. Global consumption <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34124866/" title="">is rising fast</a>, especially in middle-income countries.</p> <p>The impact is firstly on individual bodies, but through them on health services. This is a social problem that cannot be solved by telling consumers to check product labels. UPF consumption is not driven by indolence or greed, but poverty, intensive marketing and foods designed to make us keep eating: in one experiment, when diets were precisely matched for nutritional content, people ate substantially more on a UPF-only diet than on a UPF-free one.</p> <p>Taking on big food is harder than tackling big tobacco has been. It requires addressing a broad range of products that many people cannot simply cut out. But it is possible and necessary. Henry Dimbleby’s 2021 national food strategy set out a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/15/the-guardian-view-on-the-way-we-eat-do-as-dimbleby-says" title="">bold and clear approach </a>addressing both health and environmental concerns. Commissioned by Theresa May’s government, it has been essentially <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/13/food-plan-for-england-condemned-by-its-own-lead-adviser" title="">ignored by her successors</a>.</p> <p>Addressing poverty is central: when people can afford to eat more healthily, they generally do. Eligibility for free school meals should be extended – and the use of UPF slashed or eradicated in schools, prisons and hospitals. The government should ensure that people learn not only about the risks of UPF, but also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/14/food-is-a-great-source-of-pleasure-forget-that-and-we-are-doomed-to-eat-badly" title="">about how to eat well</a>. Marketing that targets children should be reined in and warning labels on products introduced, a measure that has proved highly effective in reducing demand for high salt and high sugar items <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/chiles-drastic-anti-obesity-measures-cut-sugary-drink-sales-by-23" title="">in Chile</a>, for example. This government has no appetite for action: it has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/17/ban-two-for-one-junk-food-deals-delayed-two-years" title="">shelved the ban on two-for-one offers</a> on foods high in salt, fat and sugar in England, and <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/eight-out-of-10-adults-support-ban-on-advertising-junk-food-to-children-12887345" title="">delayed a ban on advertising</a> such foods on television before 9pm. But intervention is needed to ensure that food consumption is driven by nutritional needs and appetites – not by financialised growth.</p>',
